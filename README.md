Styles the markdown preview pane like the [Homebrewery](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/), so that you can create 5th Edition D&D homebrew in a more powerful application.

## Features
- Most markdown and formatting from the Homebrewery is supported.
- Use `\page` to create new pages.

## Known Issues
- Class tables are broken
- Images from external URLs will not be shown. This is due to security restrictions on Code's markdown preview.
- The preview will sometimes scroll to the wrong place. This is a problem with Code.

## To-Do List
- Add command to enable/disable styling, even if it requires restarting Code.
- Add command to export as html. For now, just copy and paste into the homebrewery.
- Add snippets for tables, statblocks, etc.
